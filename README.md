This is my attempt to build something that matters. After spending countless hours grappling with deep questions about intelligence, consciousness, and how complex behavior emerges from simple rules, I've developed what I believe is a fundamentally different approach to neural modeling. This isn't just another neural network implementation—it's a virtual laboratory where we can experiment with the very building blocks of mind.

## My Mission

I'm convinced that the path to real artificial intelligence isn't through scaling up what we have, but through understanding the deep principles that give rise to intelligence in the first place. This project is my contribution to that effort—a stepping stone that I hope will help transform the incremental progress we see in AI today into the exponential breakthroughs we desperately need.

What you'll find here is a practical implementation of an advanced formal neuron model that I've been developing. It's designed to let us explore questions that keep me up at night: How does learning really work? What makes a system adaptive? How do simple rules give rise to complex, intelligent behavior?

## Getting Started

The system is designed for immediate experimentation. Here's how to jump in:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arteriali/neuron-model.git
cd neuron-model

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start experimenting:

```bash
# Launch the interactive CLI
python cli/neuron_cli.py

# Create a small network and start experimenting
> add_neuron 4 2 5        # Add 5 neurons with 4 synapses, 2 terminals each
> auto_connect 1 1         # Auto-connect neurons, leaving some free inputs
> signal 12345 0 1.5       # Send signal to neuron 12345, synapse 0
> nticks 10                # Execute 10 simulation steps
> web_viz                  # Launch web visualization
```

The `web_viz` command launches a real-time browser interface where you can watch your neural network in action—neurons firing, signals propagating, the whole system displaying its computational dynamics.

The web interface provides comprehensive exploration tools:

- Real-time signal propagation visualization
- Interactive neuron inspection with detailed state information
- Multiple layout algorithms for pattern recognition
- Precise signal injection with immediate visual feedback

## Research Capabilities

The system supports investigation across multiple scales and domains:

### Neural Architecture Design

- Design custom topologies: hierarchical, recurrent, feed-forward, or novel architectures
- Configure individual neuron parameters for specialized computational roles
- Create targeted circuits for specific information processing tasks
- Validate theoretical predictions through direct implementation

### Emergent Behavior Analysis

Observe how complex dynamics arise from simple local rules:

- Track signal transformation as information propagates through networks
- Monitor temporal patterns in neural activity with millisecond precision
- Analyze information flow pathways and bottlenecks
- Document emergent behaviors not explicitly programmed

### Learning Dynamics

Study adaptive mechanisms and plasticity:

- Observe real-time synaptic strength changes during learning episodes
- Investigate metaplastic adaptation in learning rules
- Analyze temporal correlation effects on synaptic modification
- Explore homeostatic mechanisms maintaining network stability

### Performance and Validation

Ensure model reliability and computational efficiency:

- Benchmark scaling behavior from single neurons to large networks
- Validate mathematical consistency across all operational conditions
- Test real-time simulation limits and computational requirements
- Verify that observed behaviors reflect genuine model properties

## Validation and Testing

Comprehensive testing ensures model reliability and mathematical consistency:

```bash
# Run specific test categories
python tests/test_mathematical_validity.py    # Core mathematics
python tests/test_network_dynamics.py         # Network behavior
python tests/test_state_transitions.py        # Temporal evolution
python tests/comprehensive_test_script.py     # Full validation
```

The testing suite validates all mathematical properties, verifies behavioral consistency, and ensures that observed phenomena reflect genuine model dynamics rather than computational artifacts.

## Join the Journey

Here's the truth: this started as a one-man obsession, but it's grown into something bigger than what I can do alone. I've spent countless hours developing the theoretical foundations and turning abstract ideas into working models, but the really exciting discoveries—the ones that will change how we think about intelligence—those will come from all of us working together.

If you're reading this and feeling that spark of curiosity, that's exactly what I was hoping for.

### Research Article

I've published an article about the early results and approach behind this research:  
**[Brain-Inspired AI: Early Results from a Radical New Neuron Model](https://hackernoon.com/brain-inspired-ai-early-results-from-a-radical-new-neuron-model)**

This article provides context about the theoretical foundations, early experimental results, and the broader vision driving this work. It's a good starting point for understanding the research direction and the questions we're exploring.

### How You Can Help

I'm looking for fellow travelers on this journey:

**If you're a researcher**: Run experiments I haven't thought of. Push the model to its limits. Find the edge cases that reveal new insights.

**If you're a developer**: Help me make this tool more powerful. There are performance optimizations waiting to be discovered, visualizations that could reveal hidden patterns, interfaces that could make exploration more intuitive.

**If you're curious**: Ask questions. Report what seems broken. Tell me what doesn't make sense. Some of my best insights have come from questions that seemed "obvious."

**If you're a theorist**: Challenge the foundations. Propose new experiments. Help me understand what this model is really telling us about intelligence.
