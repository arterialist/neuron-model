For frontend and backend repositories:

- if there are changes, the repository is eligible for the further actions
- if currently on master, create a new branch matching the format "feat/<feature-name>" or "fix/<bug-name>"
- if already on the branch that matches the format "feat/<feature-name>" or "fix/<bug-name>" and the canges match the branch name, proceed
- determine if all changes can be meaningfully grouped under one commit and commit them
- if changes would better be split to several commits, create multiple commits
- commit, push the changes to the branch
- create a PR with the changes
