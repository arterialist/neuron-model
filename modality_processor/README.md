# Modality Processor

This system sits between raw digital data and the neural network inputs. It is responsible for unifying, normalizing, chunking, and managing different data modalities (e.g., video, image, audio, text).

## Core Responsibilities

-   **Unification**: Handles various data types in a consistent way.
-   **Normalization**: Scales data to a standard range.
-   **Chunking**: Breaks down large data into smaller, manageable pieces for the network.
-   **Modality Management**: Identifies, separates, and processes different data types, preserving temporal relationships between them.

The system is designed to be modular, with each modality handled by a dedicated module. It supports data streaming and shapes its output to match the requirements of the neural network's input layer.
